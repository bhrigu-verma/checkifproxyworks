Proxy Checker for Web Scraping Projects
When working on web scraping projects, having a reliable proxy server is crucial for accessing and extracting data from websites efficiently. However, finding working proxies can be a challenging task due to the high rate of non-functional proxies available online. This Python script helps in filtering out working proxies from a list of proxies and storing them in a separate file for use in web scraping projects.

Features:
Optimized for high-speed proxy checking using concurrent execution.
Checks the status of each proxy by making HTTP requests through them.
Filters out non-working proxies and stores the working ones in a separate file.
Utilizes threading for concurrent proxy checking to improve performance.
Usage:
Input File: Create a text file named proxies.txt containing a list of proxies, with each proxy on a new line.
Run the Script: Execute the proxy_checker.py script. It will check each proxy's status and store the working proxies in a file named working_proxies.txt.
Output: The script will display the number of working proxies out of the total proxies checked and list the working proxies. Additionally, it will create a file named working_proxies.txt containing the working proxies.
